## How to Play

Colordle is a guessing game where you have 10 tries to guess a color pattern.

After each guess, you will get information about how many colors are correct and in the correct place, 
and how many colors are correct but in the incorrect place.

If you played the boardgame Mastermind, this will be very familiar to you!

npm run dev
# or
